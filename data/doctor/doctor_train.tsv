The treatment of mild anxiety: 1 massage can treat mild anxiety, noting that most people are in a state of anxiety and that there is muscle tension in certain parts of the body. The way of change is to identify the muscles of the victim and then massage for a few minutes, which also relieves pain and treats various diseases (indirectly).2. Hot baths and hot water can eliminate anxiety reactions. When we're nervous and anxious, the blood flows to the end of the limbs decreases. Hot water can restore blood circulation to the body and help it relax. Listen to music. Music is a good help against anxiety. It not only relaxes the muscles, it relaxes the spirit, it relaxes the mood, and it releases the pressure that you accumulate.4. Sports, mild anxiety treatment is also important for sports and rest. You can run, walk, play ball, etc. Any form of sport is useful, but it can be measured over time. Ten days and a half of a month's exercise will not be effective. For your drug treatment: 1)Deli's new film, one in the morning and one in the 2-3 weeks.2).................................................. Mardi Gras, one slice, three times a day, during dinner, two weeks. The high quality of sleep is very useful for the treatment of anxiety. I hope that my answer will help you to have a healthy and happy life.

ventilation	There's no air. There's no air.
ventilation	When you say farts, you think they're digestive, and you try contacting them to go to gynecology.
ventilation	That's not much of a fart.
ventilation	Consider constipation based on performance. That's not much of a fart.
ventilation	A lot of exhaust is related to diet and cooling.
ventilation	Have you been eating a lot of beans lately? Do you stink?
ventilation	Usually people put 6-15 farts a day and drain about 500-1500 ml of gas. The difference is mainly related to food that people eat, and if they eat more productive food such as potatoes, onions, etc., they fart more.
ventilation	Farts are intestines fast. It's recommended to watch for a few days, not take any more pills, see what's going on with the shit.
ventilation	How's the shit? What's it look like? You're not dry? You're farthing.
ventilation	Farting is not necessarily a bad thing.
ventilation	Farts are intestinal exhausts, which are the result of intestinal metabolites, mainly gas metabolites such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas, methane, thallium and hydrogen sulfide occurring at the same time as fermentation and transformation of various nutrients, which accumulate to the required extent and cause sufficient pressure to be released from the intestinal tract. There is a lot of sulfur, which causes the smell to stink.
ventilation	I've been farthing lately. How's the shit?
ventilation	What's with all the farts and the shit? I don't quite understand that.
ventilation	Drinks stimulate salivation in the gastrointestinal tract, which may also explain your high venting.
ventilation	Is there a lot of exhaust? Is it a lot of shit?
ventilation	It's a matter of daily vents and diets, as well as colds.
ventilation	No, there's a lot of food to eat, and it's going to rise if it doesn't come out, either by farting or breathing.
ventilation	Bullshit?
ventilation	Well, farts aren't much.
ventilation	There's not much left. There's no sign of constipation. There's not much activity at all.
ventilation	There is also some risk of intestinal infestation, most of which may result in higher exhausts, if there is frequent consumption of more bean-containing foods or of fried, greasy, hot and irritated foods, frequent drinking or poor rest. It is generally preferable to pay more attention to diet, to appropriate activities, to exercise and to enhance physical integrity,
ventilation	If there's more exhaust every day, you can add a fungus, like Lexicon, to adjust the intestinal tract.
ventilation	There's not much left. Can we take a shit?
ventilation	Maybe it's when your hand irritates your belly buttons, causing intestinal worms to increase. So fart.
ventilation	Hello, apart from farting at night, are there other symptoms? Like an increase in the number of turds or a change in fetishist?
ventilation	It's around the belly button. It's usually a lot of farts.
ventilation	The increase in the number of exhausts is related to eating habits, lifestyle or gastrointestinal diseases, which are taken into account in the absence of poor living and eating habits. The gastrointestinal function has a certain relationship with the intestinal herds, and attempts can be made to regulate the intestinal herbs by adding bipolar capsules or pulses.
ventilation	So let you eat the whole intestinal system. Pulsifiers can also be used. Is that a lot of bullshit?
ventilation	How many farts do you get when you're in pain?
ventilation	Well, how much of a fart is that?
ventilation	How about dinner these days? Is there a lot of exhaust?
ventilation	How much more of a fart?
ventilation	I've never seen anything like this before.
ventilation	Do you have a lot of farts?
ventilation	I don't know what to say.
ventilation	Hey, farts are intestinal exhausts, so long as there's no discomfort and shit, it's not a problem, it's a physiological phenomenon.
ventilation	If you eat more, you'll get more exhaust. This doesn't matter.
ventilation	But that's not usually why it stinks.
ventilation	Mm-hmm. Not much?
ventilation	Not much of a fart lately.
ventilation	Yeah. The intestinal problem can be much better after venting.
ventilation	It's got a lot to do with the intestines.
ventilation	Mm-hmm. How much more of a fart?
ventilation	Is that a lot of bullshit?
ventilation	Mm-hmm, farts aren't much.
ventilation	There's no fart. Do you eat regularly? Do you usually eat a lot?
ventilation	You can see that the food is all semi-fluid. Bullshit has nothing to do with it.
ventilation	Is there a lot of exhaust?
